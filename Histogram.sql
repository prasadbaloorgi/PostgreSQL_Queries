Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets 
posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter
users who fall into that bucket.
In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

| Column Name | Type      |
|-------------|-----------|
| tweet_id    | integer   |
| user_id     | integer   |
| msg         | string    |
| tweet_date  | timestamp |

### Example Data

| tweet_id | user_id | msg                                                                     | tweet_date           |
|----------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|

| 739252   | 111     | Despite the constant negative press covfefe                             | 2022-01-01 00:00:00  |

| 231574   | 148     | I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed                          | 2022-03-23 00:00:00  |


Based on the example output, there are two users who posted only one tweet in 2022, and one user who posted two tweets in 2022. 
The query groups the users by the number of tweets they posted and displays the number of users in each group.
